# Shutdown command

`/quit`, `finish_and_exit` and `deploy_and_exit` ask the host to shut down
through their context, and each one keeps the answer it returns. The deployment
tool is illustrative: it reports progress, returns the environment it was given
and starts no deployment process. Loading the component into an interactive host
is opt-in and requests that host's shutdown.

## Controlled runs

```sh
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=3 ~/.local/bin/capped mise exec -- just prepare-tests
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=3 ~/.local/bin/capped mise exec -- cargo nextest run --locked \
  -p maestro-extensions-wasm --lib -- shutdown_component_runs_every_registration
```
