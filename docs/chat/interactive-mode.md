# Interactive mode

`maestro_chat::InteractiveMode` holds the native terminal presentation of the
current session. This page covers what exists today: construction, startup,
the startup help and the transcript notices. Typed input, the prompt loop,
startup messages, the terminal title and the other integrations are still to come;
the mode does not yet read submitted text or prompt the session.

## Construction

`InteractiveMode::new` takes the application's `AgentSessionRuntime`, the
`InteractiveModeOptions`, the terminal and its runtime host, the theme registry
and the footer effects (`FooterOperations`, such as `NativeFooterOperations`). It
reads the current session's settings:

- `showHardwareCursor` and `terminal.clearOnShrink` configure the frame writer;
- `editorPaddingX` and `autocompleteMaxVisible` configure the editor;
- `compaction.enabled` selects the footer's `(auto)` marker.

The constructor loads key bindings from `keybindings.json` in the agent directory
and publishes them as the toolkit's registry. The footer metadata watches the
session's working directory. Last, the themes the session's resource loader has
loaded are registered and the configured `theme` is selected, so a loaded theme
wins over a shipped one with the same name. The setting is read after the loader
answers. A failure to read the bindings, build the footer's collator or load the
fallback theme is returned.

## Startup

`init` runs once; later calls change nothing. It builds the header, then adds the
header, transcript, pending-messages, status, upper widget, editor and lower widget
containers and the footer, in that order. It focuses the editor and starts the
terminal. A terminal start failure is returned and leaves the mode uninitialized.
After a successful start, a theme change invalidates the presentation and requests a
frame, and a branch change requests a frame. Neither callback keeps the mode alive.

`InteractiveModeOptions::verbose` forces the expanded startup help. Without it,
the `quietStartup` setting leaves the header empty. Otherwise the header shows the
application name and version, the compact key hints and two onboarding lines. In
verbose mode it shows the full list of key hints instead. Hints follow the loaded
bindings: several keys keep their order, and an unbound action shows no key.
Header text keeps the colours of the theme in effect when it was built.

## Notices and the editor

`show_error` and `show_warning` append an empty row and a padded notice, labelled
`Error:` or `Warning:` in the theme's error or warning colour, to the transcript.
Each requests one frame. The supplied text is kept as given, including line
breaks and its own styling. `clear_editor` empties the editor and requests a
frame; the editor's history is kept.
