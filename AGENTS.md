# Working on Maestro

## Flow

Land a spec on `main` under `docs/specs/` first. Then use `/to-tickets`,
`/implement` (with `/tdd`, then `/code-review`), `/pr`, and `/retro`.
Issues link to the spec rather than copying it.
The current foundation contract is [the Maestro specification](docs/specs/maestro-port.md).
Deliver crate by crate; write each crate's tickets when that crate is reached.

## Checks

Install mise and rustup, enable mise on `PATH`, then run:

```sh
mise install
just setup
just ci
```

`just setup` installs pinned tools and prek hooks. `just check` runs formatting,
Clippy with warnings denied, strict public rustdoc and workspace conventions.
`just test` runs all tests; `just ci` runs both, matching shared Linux CI.
Rust is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` and installed by rustup, never mise.
Use `mise exec -- just <recipe>` if mise is not active in your shell.

The commit hook formats the code, re-stages the staged files and runs
`just check`; unformatted code is fixed, never rejected. It also rejects
merge-conflict markers and invalid TOML or YAML. Commit messages need a
conventional header and every line must be at most 80 columns.

## Documentation

Every change has a clear conventional commit message (the squash commit)
describing user-visible behavior. Pull requests never edit `CHANGELOG.md`.
The changelog is generated from conventional commits at release time.

Every crate root needs `//!` docs and every public item needs `///` docs.
`just check` denies rustdoc warnings and missing documentation.

All Rust comments describe the code, not planning material. Never include
numbered slices, specs, tasks or tickets, issue/pull-request references,
planning vocabulary or planning identifiers. Workspace conventions scan
comments in all member Rust files, reporting file and line; strings and
attributes are not comments. No allowlist or exceptions: reword a false
positive. Ordinary technical terms such as "the JSON-RPC specification",
"an async task", "step 1 of the parse", "UTF-16" and "S3-compatible" pass.

## Crates

- One job per crate, describable in one sentence without "and".
- Dependencies point one way; core crates never depend on dedicated
  (non-core) crates.
- Names follow `maestro-<noun>[-<role>]`.
- The composition-root crate, `maestro`, owns the binary and only wires.

Conventions enforce the [foundation graph](docs/specs/maestro-port.md#crates-and-delivery-order)
through declared and host-resolved Cargo metadata, including optional, target and
build edges. Classes are distinct from delivery layers: only the binary root,
conventions checker and terminal scenario harness are dedicated. Sparse workspaces
need no placeholder crates. Frontends require their full direct sets; the terminal
adapter and scenario harness require toolkit only. Other non-leaves permit subsets.
Production and test graphs are separately acyclic; the internal dev-target
allowlist is empty. The scenario harness is not a general dev-dependency target.

Bounded source/build checks enforce tool/selector ownership, direct runtime-engine
and toolkit library placement, canonical guest-owned WIT inputs and planning-comment
policy. They ignore literals/comments when finding declarations. Dynamic WIT inputs
require review and never count as verified. Manual review still proves generic
caller context, wiring-only binaries, no frontend application policy, complete
code-generation evidence and framework/highlighting equivalents. See
[architecture checks](docs/architecture.md) for commands, diagnostics and limits.
Publish reusable adapter conformance from the owning leaf, not a forwarding test crate.

## Libraries and formats

Only these libraries are owner-approved: tokio, reqwest, serde, serde_json,
toml, clap, rmcp, tracing, and globset. Use Git through the `git` command.
Ask the owner before adding any other crate; never add one silently.

Owner-approved model validation exception: `jsonschema` 0.58.5 with default
features disabled, used only through the model crate's private schema module.
Keep HTTP/file and asynchronous retrieval, TLS, idna, macros and all other optional
features disabled; construction must also explicitly use the offline builder.
No remote schema retrieval is authorized.

Keep one current format for everything. No compatibility code.

### Issue tracker

Issues are GitHub Issues in `Orchestration-Maestro/maestro`; specs land on
`main` first. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Matt Pocock's five default triage labels. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context, with the glossary in `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs in `docs/adr/`.
